# Employee-salary-prediction-using-multiple-linear-regression
In this project, we built a model to predict the employee wage using critical data insights from assessments of the person's experience, skill sets, and aptitude to solve real-world challenges. Regression analysis was then employed by our model to properly assess the employee's pay.
